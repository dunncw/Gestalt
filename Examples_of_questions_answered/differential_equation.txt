The differential equation y'' + y = 0 is a second-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation (ODE) with constant coefficients. It is a type of differential equation known as a homogeneous linear differential equation with constant coefficients.

The characteristic equation for this differential equation is obtained by replacing y, y', and y'' with the unknown constant e^(rt), where r is the characteristic root:

r^2 + 1 = 0

Solving for r, we find that the characteristic roots are r = Â±i, where i is the imaginary unit.

So, the general solution to the differential equation is:

y(t) = c1cos(t) + c2sin(t)

where c1 and c2 are arbitrary constants, and cos(t) and sin(t) are the standard trigonometric functions.

This solution can be verified by differentiating twice and substituting it into the original differential equation.
