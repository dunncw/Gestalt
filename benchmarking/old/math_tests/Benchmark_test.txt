        "Rationale": "the problem asks for the approximate chance that no more than 1 / 3 of the original investment is lost . we can apply the \u201c 1 \u2013 x \u201d technique : what \u2019 s the chance that more than 1 / 3 of the original investment is lost ? there are two outcomes we have to separately measure : ( a ) all 3 investments become worthless .
