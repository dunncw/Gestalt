A vertical asymptote occurs when the graph becomes infinitely large, which happens when the denominator is equal to $0$. The denominator $(x+3)(x-2)$ is equal to zero when $x=-3$ or $x=2$.

$n$ fair 6-sided dice are simultaneously rolled. The probability that exactly two of them show a number other than 1 is $\frac{25}{216}$. Find $n$.,"For $n$ dice, there are $\binom{n}{2}=\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ ways to choose two of them. For each of these ways, there is a $\left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^2 \left( \frac{1}{6} \right)^{n-2}$ chance that all but the chosen two dice will roll a 1. Therefore, we need to find the value of $n$ for which $\frac{25n(n-1)}{2 \cdot 6^n}=\frac{25}{216}$, or $108n(n-1)=6^n$. Plugging in values for $n$, we can see that $n=\boxed{4}$ works and no value of $n$ less than 4 works. Now we just need to prove that no values of $n$ greater than 4 work. Note that if $n \geq 5$, then $n < 3^{n-3}$ and $n-1 < 2\cdot 2^{n-3}$. We can multiply these inequalities to get that when $n \geq 5$, we have $n(n-1) < 2\cdot 6^{n-3}$, or $108n(n-1)<6^n$.",,,,failed to answer,

If John spins a 20 on his first spin, what is the maximum number of total spins (including the one he already made) that John can make before the game is over?","If John spins a 20, then Gary's list contains the numbers 1, 2, 4, 5, 10. Thus, these are the numbers on the second spinner.

If John spins a 1, then Gary's list will be empty because there are no positive factors of 1 besides itself. Thus, the game will be over. This yields a maximum of 1 additional spin.

If John spins a 2, then Gary's list will only contain the number 1. Then on John's next spin, we will have the same scenario as above. This yields a maximum of 2 additional spins.

If John spins a 4, then Gary's list will contain the numbers 1 and 2. As we have already found above, spinning a 2 yields more additional spins than a 1, so the maximum additional spins in this case is 3 spins.

If John spins a 5, then Gary's list will only contain the number 1. As above, this will yield a maximum of 2 additional spins.

Finally, if John spins a 10, then Gary's list will contain the numbers 1, 2, and 5. Of these numbers, 2 and 5 have the highest maximum number of additional spins, so this case has a maximum of 3 additional spins.

Thus, of all of the possibilities, spinning a 4 or 10 next could result in 3 additional spins, so the maximum total number of spins is $\boxed{4}$. These would be achieved by spinning 20, 10, 2, 1 or 20, 10, 5, 1 or 20, 4, 2, 1.","[(AgentAction(tool='python_repl', tool_input='def factors(n): return [i for i in range(1, n) if n % i == 0]; print(factors(20))', log=""Thought: I need to find the maximum number of total spins John can make if he starts with 20.

The student's work and answer are correct. They have considered all possible scenarios after spinning a 20 and determined that the maximum total number of spins is 4, which can be achieved by spinning 20, 10, 2, 1 or 20, 10, 5, 1 or 20, 4, 2, 1.","To maximize the number of spins, we want to find a chain of numbers with the most positive factors. When John spins 20, the factors of 20, except for 20 itself, are 1, 2, 4, 5, and 10. Let us examine each factor.

1. If John spins a 1, the game ends becuase 1 has no factors other than itself. So, this path is not optimal.
2. If John spins a 2, the next spinner will have only one factor, which is 1, and the game will end. So, this path is not optimal as well.
3. If John spins a 4, the factors of 4 (excluding 4) are 1 and 2. Spinning 1 will end the game, but spinning 2 will lead to one final round, as the only factor of 2 is 1 (1 round for spinning 20, 1 round for 4, and 1 round for 2, a total of 3 rounds).
4. If John spins a 5, the game will end as 5 has only one factor, which is 1. So, this path is also not optimal.
5. If John spins a 10, the factors of 10, except 10 itself, are 1, 2, and 5. In each case, spinning 1 will end the game, as will spinning 5. Spinning 2 will lead to one final round (1 round for spinning 20, 1 round for 10, and 1 round for 2, a total of 3 rounds).

The longest chain so far is 20 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1, which has a total of 3 rounds including the initial spin made by John. Therefore, the maximum number of spins John can make before the game is over is 3.","INCORRECT. The student's answer of 3 total rounds is not correct. The correct answer is 4 total spins, as spinning 20, 10, 2, 1, or 20, 10, 5, 1 or 20, 4, 2, 1 would maximize the game length. The student did not consider all possible combinations and arrived at an incorrect conclusion."
What is the smallest multiple of $5$ which is greater than $-32$?,"Dividing $-32$ by $5$ gives $-6$ with a remainder of $-2$, or $$-32 = -6 \cdot 5 - 2.$$Thus, $-6 \cdot 5 = \boxed{-30}$ is the smallest multiple of $5$ that is greater than $-32$.","[(AgentAction(tool='python_repl', tool_input='import math; smallest_multiple = math.ceil(-32 / 5) * 5; print(smallest_multiple)', log='Thought: I need to find the smallest multiple of 5 greater than -32.\nAction: python_repl\nAction Input: import math; smallest_multiple = math.ceil(-32 / 5) * 5; print(smallest_multiple)'), '-30\n')]",,"CORRECT. The student correctly applied the division algorithm to find the smallest multiple of $5$ greater than $-32$, which is $-30$.","We can find the multiple of $5$ closest to and smaller than $-32$ by dividing $-32$ by $5$:

$$\frac{-32}{5} = -6\frac{2}{5}$$

The closest smaller multiple is $-6 \times 5 = -30$. To find the smallest multiple of $5$ greater than $-32$, we just need to add $5$ to $-30$:

$$-30 + 5 = -25$$

So, the smallest multiple of $5$ which is greater than $-32$ is $\boxed{-25}$.","INCORRECT. The student made a mistake in understanding the remainder when dividing $-32$ by $5$. The correct division result is $$-32 = -6 \cdot 5 - 2.$$ Thus, the smallest multiple of $5$ greater than $-32$ is actually $-6\cdot5 +5=-30$ and not $-25$."

\[\mathbf{b} = \operatorname{proj}_{\mathbf{a}} \mathbf{b} + \operatorname{proj}_{\mathbf{b}} \mathbf{b}.\]From the projection formula,
\[\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbf{a}} \mathbf{b} = \frac{\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}}{\|\mathbf{a}\|^2} \mathbf{a},\]and $\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbf{b}} \mathbf{b} = \mathbf{b},$ so

\[\frac{\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}}{\|\mathbf{a}\|^2} \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}.\]The vector $\mathbf{a}$ must be nonzero, in order for the projection of $\mathbf{v}$ onto $\mathbf{a}$ to be defined, so we must have $\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = \boxed{0}.$
