How many vertical asymptotes does the graph of $y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}$ have?,"The denominator of the rational function factors into $x^2+x-6=(x-2)(x+3)$. Since the numerator is always nonzero, there is a vertical asymptote whenever the denominator is $0$, which occurs for $x = 2$ and $x = -3$.  Therefore, the graph has $\boxed{2}$ vertical asymptotes.","[(AgentAction(tool='Calculator', tool_input='x^2 + x - 6 = 0', log='Thought: I need to find the vertical asymptotes of the given function. Vertical asymptotes occur when the denominator of a rational function is equal to zero.\nAction: Calculator\nAction Input: x^2 + x - 6 = 0'), 'Answer: x = 2 or x = -3')]",2,"CORRECT. The student correctly factored the denominator and found the two values for x, $x=-3$ and $x=2$, that make the denominator equal to zero. As a result, the graph has 2 vertical asymptotes.","First, we need to factor the denominator of the given function:

$x^2 + x - 6 = (x+3)(x-2)$

Now we check for the values of $x$ that make the denominator equal to zero:

1. $(x+3) = 0 \implies x = -3$
2. $(x-2) = 0 \implies x = 2$

These are the points at which the function would be undefined and likely to have vertical asymptotes. Therefore, the graph of $y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}$ has 2 vertical asymptotes.","CORRECT. The student correctly factored the denominator, identified the values of $x$ that make the denominator equal to zero, and concluded that there are 2 vertical asymptotes."
The probability of rain tomorrow is $\frac{1}{11}$.  What is the probability that it will not rain tomorrow?  Express your answer as a common fraction.,"It must either rain tomorrow or not rain tomorrow, so the sum of the probability that it rains and the probability it doesn't rain is 1.  Therefore, the probability it doesn't rain is $1 - \frac{1}{11} = \boxed{\frac{10}{11}}$.","[(AgentAction(tool='Calculator', tool_input='1 - 1/11', log='Thought: To find the probability that it will not rain tomorrow, I need to subtract the probability of rain from 1.\nAction: Calculator\nAction Input: 1 - 1/11'), 'Answer: 0.9090909090909091'), (AgentAction(tool='wolfram_alpha', tool_input='convert 0.9090909090909091 to a fraction', log='I need to convert the decimal to a common fraction.\nAction: wolfram_alpha\nAction Input: convert 0.9090909090909091 to a fraction'), 'Assumption: rationalize | 0.9090909090909091 \nAnswer: 10/11')]",$\frac{10}{11}$,"CORRECT. The student correctly subtracted the probability of rain from 1 to find the probability of no rain, and then properly converted the decimal to the common fraction $\frac{10}{11}$.","The probability of an event not happening is equal to 1 minus the probability of the event happening. In this case, the probability of it not raining tomorrow is $1 - \frac{1}{11} = \frac{11}{11} - \frac{1}{11} = \boxed{\frac{10}{11}}$.",CORRECT. The student correctly applied the concept that the probability of an event not happening is equal to 1 minus the probability of the event happening. They calculated the correct probability of it not raining tomorrow as $\frac{10}{11}$.
