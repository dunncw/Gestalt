"For a given constant $b > 10,$ there are two possible triangles $ABC$ satisfying $AB = 10,$ $AC = b,$ and $\sin B = \frac{3}{5}.$  Find the positive difference between the lengths of side $\overline{BC}$ in these two triangles.","We have that
\[\cos^2 B = 1 - \sin^2 B = \frac{16}{25},\]so $\cos B = \pm \frac{4}{5}.$

For $\cos B = \frac{4}{5},$ let $a_1 = BC.$  Then by the Law of Cosines,
\[b^2 = a_1^2 + 100 - 20a_1 \cdot \frac{4}{5} = a_1^2 - 16a_1 + 100.\]For $\cos B = -\frac{4}{5},$ let $a_2 = BC.$  Then by the Law of Cosines,
\[b^2 = a_2^2 + 100 - 20a_2 \cdot \left( -\frac{4}{5} \right) = a_2^2 + 16a_2 + 100.\]Subtracting these equations, we get
\[a_2^2 - a_1^2 + 16a_2 + 16a_1 = 0.\]We can factor as $(a_2 - a_1)(a_2 + a_1) + 16(a_2 + a_1) = 0.$  Since $a_1 + a_2$ is positive, we can safely divide both sides by $a_1 + a_2,$ to get

Two consecutive positive even numbers are each squared.  The  difference of the squares is 60.

$4x + 4 = 60$

Subtract 4 from both sides:

$4x = 56$

The sets $A = \{z : z^{18} = 1\}$ and $B = \{w : w^{48} = 1\}$ are both sets of complex roots of unity. The set $C = \{zw : z \in A ~ \mbox{and} ~ w \in B\}$ is also a set of complex roots of unity. How many distinct elements are in $C^{}_{}$?,"Note that $\operatorname{lcm}(18,48) = 144.$  So,
\[(zw)^{144} = z^{144} w^{144} = (z^{18})^8 \cdot (w^{48})^3 = 1.\]Hence, every element in $C$ is a 144th root of unity.

Conversely, consider an arbitrary 144th root of unity, say
\[\operatorname{cis} \frac{2 \pi k}{144}.\]Note that $\operatorname{cis} \frac{2 \pi (2k)}{18} \in A$ and $\operatorname{cis} \frac{2 \pi (-5k)}{48} \in B,$ and their product is

Then $z^{18} = e^{18i\theta_z} = 1$ and $w^{48} = e^{48i\theta_w} = 1$. 

From the first equation, we see that $\theta_z = k_z\frac{2\pi}{18} = k_z\frac{\pi}{9}$ for some integer $k_z$, such that $0 \leq k_z \leq 17$ (there are 18 possible values for $z$). From the second equation, we have $\theta_w = k_w\frac{2\pi}{48} = k_w\frac{\pi}{24}$ for some integer $k_w$, such that $0 \leq k_w \leq 47$ (which gives us 48 possible values for $w$).

Thus, the angle of $zw$ is given by $\theta_z + \theta_w = k_z\frac{\pi}{9} + k_w\frac{\pi}{24}$. In order for $C$ to be a set of complex roots of unity, the angles of the elements in $C$ must be a multiple of $\frac{2\pi}{n}$ for some nonnegative integer $n$.

Let's find the smallest positive $\theta$ generated by $\theta_z + \theta_w$. Since $\theta_z$ and $\theta_w$ are not both zero, let's consider cases where either $\theta_z$ or $\theta_w$ is nonzero.

1. If $\theta_z > 0$, the smallest positive angle of $z$ is $\frac{\pi}{9}$, and we can let $\theta_w = 0$. In this case, the smallest positive $\theta$ is $\frac{\pi}{9}$.

2. If $\theta_w > 0$, the smallest positive angle of $w$ is $\frac{\pi}{24}$, and we can let $\theta_z = 0$. In this case, the smallest positive $\theta$ is $\frac{\pi}{24}$.

Thus, the smallest positive angle generated by $\theta_z + \theta_w$ is $\frac{\pi}{24}$. So, the angles of the complex numbers in the set $C$ must be of the form $k\frac{2\pi}{24} = k\frac{\pi}{12}$ for some integer $k$. Since we must find distinct elements in $C$, we need the possible values of $k$ giving distinct angles, which ranges from $0$ to $23$.

Therefore, there are $\boxed{24}$ distinct elements in the set $C$.","INCORRECT. The student's approach to find the smallest positive angle generated by $\theta_z + \theta_w$ is not valid in this case.

2. $(n-2) = 1$: In this case, $n = 3$. The expression becomes $(3-1)(3-2) = 2 \times 1 = 2$, which is prime.

Since we found one value of $n$ that results in a prime number, there is $\boxed{1}$ positive integer $n$ for which $n^2 - 3n + 2$ is a prime number.","CORRECT. The student factored the expression correctly and considered both scenarios, ultimately finding that the expression is prime only when $n=3$. The reasoning and conclusion match the actual answer, so the student's work is correct."
"In right triangle $ABC$ with $\angle B = 90^\circ$, we have $\sin A = 2\cos A$.  What is $\cos A$?","The triangle is shown below:

[asy]
pair A,B,C;
A = (0,0);
B = (5,0);
C = (5,10);
draw(A--B--C--A);
draw(rightanglemark(C,B,A,16));
label(""$A$"",A,SW);
label(""$B$"",B,SE);
label(""$C$"",C,N);
[/asy]

We have $\sin A = \frac{BC}{AC}$ and $\cos A = \frac{AB}{AC}$, so $\sin A = 2\cos A$ gives us $\frac{BC}{AC} = 2\cdot\frac{AB}{AC}$.  Multiplying both sides by $AC$ gives $BC = 2AB$.

The Pythagorean Theorem gives us $AB^2 + BC^2 = AC^2$.  Substituting $BC = 2AB$ gives \[AB^2 + (2AB)^2 = AC^2.\]Simplifying the left side gives $5AB^2 = AC^2$, so $\frac{AB^2}{AC^2} = \frac{1}{5}$, which means \[\cos A = \frac{AB}{AC} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{5}} = \frac{\sqrt{1}}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} = \boxed{\frac{\sqrt{5}}{5}}.\]",1108,"[(AgentAction(tool='wolfram_alpha', tool_input='solve sin A = 2 cos A and sin^2 A + cos^2 A = 1 for cos A', log='Thought: I can use the Pythagorean identity to solve for cos A.\nAction: wolfram_alpha\nAction Input: solve sin A = 2 cos A and sin^2 A + cos^2 A = 1 for cos A'), 'Assumption: solve sin(A) = 2 cos(A)\nsin^2(A) + cos^2(A) = 1 for cos(A) \nAnswer: 2 cos(A) = sin(A)')]",,INCORRECT.

In this case, $\cos A = \cos 0^\circ = \boxed{1}$.","INCORRECT. The student made a wrong assumption about the angle A being equal to 0 degrees.

They then evaluated the expression correctly to get the answer of 4.","We have $a = 8$ and we want to find the value of $\left(16\sqrt[3]{a^2}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}}$. First, let's simplify the expression under the radical.

$$16\sqrt[3]{a^2} = 16\sqrt[3]{8^2} = 16\sqrt[3]{64}$$

Now raise this expression to the power of $\frac{1}{3}$:

$$\left(16\sqrt[3]{64}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}} = (16^\frac{1}{3})(\sqrt[3]{64})^\frac{1}{3}$$

The student correctly calculated the number of edges in the pentagonal prism as 15 and then used the binomial coefficient to find the total pairs of vertices. They subtracted 15 from 45 to get the final answer of 30 diagonals.,"To find the number of diagonals in a pentagonal prism, we'll first find the number of diagonals in the top and bottom pentagons and then find the number of diagonals formed by combining the vertices of the top and bottom pentagons.

A pentagon has 5 vertices. Apply the formula for diagonals in a polygon, which is given by:
$D = \frac{n(n-3)}{2}$, where D is the number of diagonals and n is the number of vertices.

For the pentagon, n = 5:
$D = \frac{5(5-3)}{2} = \frac{5 \cdot 2}{2} = 5$

So, each pentagon (the top and bottom) has 5 diagonals. Since there are two pentagons, there are a total of $5 + 5 = 10$ diagonals in the top and bottom pentagons.

Now, we'll find the number of diagonals formed by combining the vertices of the top and bottom pentagons. For each vertex on the top pentagon, it can form a diagonal with 2 non-adjacent vertices on the bottom pentagon. Thus, there are 2 diagonals for each of the 5 vertices in the top pentagon. Therefore, there are 5 * 2 = 10 diagonals formed when combining the vertices of the top and bottom pentagons.

So, the total number of diagonals in a pentagonal prism is the sum of diagonals in the top and bottom pentagons and the diagonals formed by combining their vertices, which is $10 + 10 = 20$. Therefore, a pentagonal prism has 20 diagonals.","INCORRECT. The student did not correctly count the diagonals formed by combining the vertices of the top and bottom pentagons. They incorrectly assumed that there were only 2 diagonals for each vertex on the top pentagon when there are actually 4 diagonals for each vertex (each vertex is joined to all other vertices except for the two adjacent vertices on the top, and the two vertices directly below on the bottom pentagon). So, there are 5 * 4 = 20 diagonals formed when combining the vertices of the top and bottom pentagons.

Since there are $5+5=10$ diagonals in the top and bottom pentagons, the total number of diagonals in a pentagonal prism is the sum of diagonals in the top and bottom pentagons and the diagonals formed by combining their vertices, which is $10 + 20 = 30$. Therefore, a pentagonal prism has 30 diagonals, not 20 as the student stated."
