\[\bold{v} = \bold{p}\]when $t = 0$.  Hence, $\bold{p} = \bold{a}$, so the equation of the line is

To see why, consider that $(x^4)^3 = x^{12}$, $(x^4)^2 = x^8$, and $x^4$, and when you plug those into $p(x^4)$, you get the desired equation.

Now, notice that $p(2009) = p(9002) = 0$, so $x^4 - 2009$ and $x^4 - 9002$ must be factors of $p(x)$. We also know that $p(2009 + 9002 \pi i) = 0$. Plugging this into $p(x)$ gives us an equation that relates $a$, $b$, $c$, and $\pi$:

$$p(2009 + 9002 \pi i) = (2009 + 9002 \pi i)^3 + a(2009 + 9002 \pi i)^2 + b(2009 + 9002 \pi i) + c = 0$$

We want to find the complex zeros of $x^{12} + ax^8 + bx^4 + c$, which is equivalent to finding the zeros of $p(x^4)$. We already know that $x^4 = 2009$ and $x^4 = 9002$ must be zeros of this polynomial. The last zero must be a complex number, since all cubic polynomials with real coefficients have at least one real root and the only remaining root must be complex.

Let $r$ be the last nonreal zero of the polynomial $p(x^4)$. This implies that $r^4$ must be a zero of $p(x)$. So, the three zeros of $p(x)$ are 2009, 9002, and $r^4$, and since their product is equal to $c$ (since $p(x) = x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c$), we have $c = 2009 \cdot 9002 \cdot r^4$. Now if we look at the conjugate $r^*_4$ of $r^4$, we can see that it must also be a root of $p(x)$, since when we conjugate the equation $c = 2009 \cdot 9002 \cdot r^4$, we have $c^* = 2009 \cdot 9002 \cdot r^{*4}$ and since $a, b$ and $c$ are all real, $c^*=c$. So the conjugate of $r^4$ must be a root of $p(x)$ as well. 

Thus, the polynomial $p(x^4)$ has four complex zeros: $r, r^*, s,$ and $s^*$ (where $r$ and $s$ are the square roots of the two complex roots $r^4$ and $r^{*4}$ of $p(x)$). Notice that all the powers of these zeros are also zeros. In particular:

$$r^3, r^{*3}, s^3, s^{*3}$$

So, there are $\boxed{4}$ nonreal zeros of $x^{12} + ax^8 + bx^4 + c$.","INCORRECT. While the student correctly identified that the equation can be written as $p(x^4)$ and discussed finding the zeros of this polynomial, they made a mistake when they stated that the conjugate of a nonreal root of $p(x^4)$ must also be a root of $p(x)$. They should have considered each case separately:

1. $x^4 - (2009 + 9002\pi i) = 0$: The 4th roots will be nonreal.

2. $x^4 - 2009 = 0$: There are two real roots and two nonreal roots.

3. $x^4 - 9002 = 0$: There are two real roots and two nonreal roots.

Thus, there are $4+2+2=8$ nonreal zeros, not 4 as the student has claimed."
"Let $(x,y)$ be an ordered pair of real numbers that satisfies the equation $x^2+y^2=14x+48y$. What is the maximum value of $y$?","Moving all the terms to the left, we have the equation $x^2-14x+y^2-48y=0$. Completing the square on the quadratic in $x$, we add $(14/2)^2=49$ to both sides. Completing the square on the quadratic in $y$, we add $(48/2)^2=576$ to both sides. We have the equation  \[(x^2-14x+49)+(y^2-48y+576)=625 \Rightarrow (x-7)^2+(y-24)^2=625\] Rearranging, we have $(y-24)^2=625-(x-7)^2$. Taking the square root and solving for $y$, we get $y=\pm \sqrt{625-(x-7)^2}+24$. Since $\sqrt{625-(x-7)^2}$ is always nonnegative, the maximum value of $y$ is achieved when we use a positive sign in front of the square root. Now, we want the largest possible value of the square root. In other words, we want to maximize $625-(x-7)^2$. Since $(x-7)^2$ is always nonnegative, $625-(x-7)^2$ is maximized when $(x-7)^2=0$ or when $x=7$. At this point, $625-(x-7)^2=625$ and $y=\sqrt{625}+24=49$. Thus, the maximum $y$ value is $\boxed{49}$.

\[\frac{x}{y}=\frac{1}{2}\]

We are given the equation $y=4x-36$. We can substitute this equation into the ratio equation:

\[\frac{x}{4x-36}=\frac{1}{2}\]

Now we can solve for $x$. First, we cross-multiply:

\[2x=1(4x-36)\]

Distribute the $1$ on right-hand side:

\[2x=4x-36\]

Now, we can move the terms with $x$ to one side and the constant term to the other side:

\[2x-4x=-36\]

Combine like terms:

\[-2x=-36\]

Now, divide both sides by $-2$ to find the value of $x$:

\[x=18\]

So, the value of $x$ is $18$.","CORRECT. The student has carefully followed the steps to solve the given problem, including setting up the ratio equation, substituting the given equation into the ratio equation, and solving for x. They arrived at the correct answer, $x=18$."
Let $x$ be a number that satisfies both equations $18x^2+25x-3=0$ and $4x^2+8x+3=0$. Find the value of $x$.,"We begin by factoring both quadratics. We find that the $18x^2+25x-3=0$ factors to: \[ (2x+3)(9x-1)=0. \]Thus, the only values of $x$ that satisfy this equation are $-\frac32$ and $\frac19$. When we factor the second quadratic, $4x^2+8x+3=0$, we find that it is equal to: \[ (2x+1)(2x+3)=0. \]Thus, the only values that satisfy this equation are $-\frac12$ and $-\frac32$. Since $-\frac32$ is the only root both polynomials have in common, the answer must be $\boxed{-\frac32}$",153,"[(AgentAction(tool='wolfram_alpha', tool_input='What are the roots of 18x^2 + 25x - 3?', log='Thought: I need to find the value of x that satisfies both equations.

The student's work is thorough and correct. They accurately factored both quadratics and found the common root of both equations to be $-\frac32$.,"We need to solve the system of quadratic equations. Let us solve the first equation for $x$:

$18x^2 + 25x - 3 = 0$

We can use the quadratic formula to solve for $x$:

$x = \dfrac{-B\pm \sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A}$, where $A = 18$, $B = 25$, and $C = -3$ in this case.

$x = \dfrac{-25\pm\sqrt{25^2-4(18)(-3)}}{2(18)}$

$x = \dfrac{-25\pm\sqrt{625+216}}{36}$

$x = \dfrac{-25\pm\sqrt{841}}{36}$

Since $\sqrt{841}=29$, the two possible values of $x$ are:

$x_1 = \dfrac{-25+29}{36} = \dfrac{4}{36} = \dfrac{1}{9}$

$x_2 = \dfrac{-25-29}{36} = \dfrac{-54}{36} = -\dfrac{3}{2}$

Now we need to determine which of these values of $x$ also satisfy the second equation $4x^2+8x+3=0$. Let's test both values:

For $x_1 = \dfrac{1}{9}$:

$4 \left(\dfrac{1}{9}\right)^2 + 8 \left(\dfrac{1}{9}\right) + 3 = 4 \left(\dfrac{1}{81}\right) + \dfrac{8}{9} + 3 = \dfrac{4}{81} + \dfrac{72}{81} + \dfrac{243}{81} = \dfrac{319}{81} \neq 0$

For $x_2 = -\dfrac{3}{2}$:

$4 \left(-\dfrac{3}{2}\right)^2 + 8 \left(-\dfrac{3}{2}\right) + 3 = 4 \left(\dfrac{9}{4}\right) - 12 + 3 = 9 - 12 + 3 = 0$

So, the value of $x$ that satisfies both equations is $x=-\dfrac{3}{2}$.","CORRECT. The student correctly solved the quadratic equations and identified the correct common root, $x=-\frac{3}{2}$. Their calculations and explanation are accurate and clear."
How many positive factors of 4000 are multiples of 100?,"We have $4000=2^5\cdot5^3$. Any factor of 4000 is in the form $2^a\cdot5^b$ for $0\le a\le5$ and $0\le b\le3$. Since $100=2^2\cdot5^2$, we must count the factors of 4000 that have $a\ge2$ and $b\ge2$.

We have:

$4000 = 2^4 * 5^3$

Next, let's determine how many factors of 4000 there are. For each prime factor in the prime factorization, we add 1 to its exponent and then multiply the results together. So, the number of factors of 4000 is:

$(4 + 1) * (3 + 1) = 5 * 4 = 20$

Now, we need to consider the multiples of 100. Since 100 = 2^2 * 5^2, we only want factors of 4000 that have at least these exponents of 2 and 5. Thus, for 2, we have 2 remaining possibilities (exponents 2, 3 or 4) and for 5, we have 1 remaining possibility (exponent 3).

So the total number of factors of 4000 that are multiples of 100 is:

The student's work follows the correct steps in solving for the remainder. They used the given information, set up a system of equations, and found the correct values for $a$ and $b$. The final answer of the remainder being $6x$ is also accurate.","Let's denote:

$$P(x) = x + x^3 + x^9 + x^{27} + x^{81} + x^{243}$$

Notice that $x^2 - 1 = (x - 1)(x + 1)$, so we are looking for the remainder when $P(x)$ is divided by $(x-1)$ and $(x+1)$.

We start by finding the remainder when $P(x)$ is divided by $(x-1)$. We evaluate $P(1)$:

$$P(1) = 1 + 1^3 + 1^9 + 1^{27} + 1^{81} + 1^{243} = 6$$

So the remainder when $P(x)$ is divided by $(x-1)$ is $R_1(x) = 6$.

Next, we find the remainder when $P(x)$ is divided by $(x+1)$. We evaluate $P(-1)$:

$$P(-1) = -1 + (-1)^3 + (-1)^9 + (-1)^{27} + (-1)^{81} + (-1)^{243} = -(1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1) = -6$$

So the remainder when $P(x)$ is divided by $(x+1)$ is $R_2(x) = -6$.

Now, we need to find the polynomial $R(x)$ which has remainder $6$ when divided by $x-1$ and $-6$ when divided by $x+1$. To do this, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Let's find the inverse of $(x-1)$ modulo $(x+1)$. 

We have:

$$(x-1)((x-1)^{-1}) \equiv 1 \pmod{(x+1)}$$
$$((x-1)((x-1)^{-1})+1) = (x+1)k$$
$$(-(x-1)((x-1)^{-1})-1) = (x+1)(-k)$$
$$(x-1)((x-1)^{-1}) \equiv -1 \pmod{(x+1)}$$

Comparing the last two congruences, we can see that $((x-1)^{-1}) \equiv -1 \pmod{(x+1)}$. Thus, the inverse of $(x-1)$ modulo $(x+1)$ is $-1$.

Now we can apply the Chinese Remainder Theorem:

$$R(x) = R_1(x) + (P(x) - R_1(x))((x-1)^{-1}) \pmod{(x+1)}$$
$$R(x) = 6 + (P(x) - 6)(-1) \pmod{(x+1)}$$
$$R(x) = 6 - (P(x) - 6) \pmod{(x+1)}$$
$$R(x) = 6 - P(x) + 6 \pmod{(x+1)}$$
$$R(x) \equiv - P(x) + 12 \pmod{(x+1)}$$

Now we can find $R(x)$ by substituting $x = -1$:

$$R(-1) = - P(-1) + 12 = -(-6) + 12 = 6 + 12 = 18$$

So, the remainder when the polynomial $P(x)$ is divided by $x^2-1$ is $\boxed{18}$.","INCORRECT. The student's answer of 18 is incorrect. The remainder should be in the form of $ax + b$, and to find the correct remainder, plug the values of 1 and -1 into the original equation instead of into the student's form of $R(x)$.

"John and Gary are playing a game. John spins a spinner numbered with integers from 1 to 20. Gary then writes a list of all of the positive factors of the number spun except for the number itself. Gary then creates a new spinner with all of the numbers on his list. John then spins this spinner, and the process continues. The game is over when the spinner has no numbers on it. If John spins a 20 on his first spin, what is the maximum number of total spins (including the one he already made) that John can make before the game is over?","If John spins a 20, then Gary's list contains the numbers 1, 2, 4, 5, 10. Thus, these are the numbers on the second spinner.

If John spins a 1, then Gary's list will be empty because there are no positive factors of 1 besides itself. Thus, the game will be over. This yields a maximum of 1 additional spin.

If John spins a 2, then Gary's list will only contain the number 1. Then on John's next spin, we will have the same scenario as above. This yields a maximum of 2 additional spins.

If John spins a 4, then Gary's list will contain the numbers 1 and 2. As we have already found above, spinning a 2 yields more additional spins than a 1, so the maximum additional spins in this case is 3 spins.

If John spins a 5, then Gary's list will only contain the number 1. As above, this will yield a maximum of 2 additional spins.

Finally, if John spins a 10, then Gary's list will contain the numbers 1, 2, and 5. Of these numbers, 2 and 5 have the highest maximum number of additional spins, so this case has a maximum of 3 additional spins.

Since both $A$ and $B$ can only be single-digit numbers, their maximum values are 9. Therefore, we must have $A \times b \leq 47$. We can test various values of $b$:

If $b = 4$, we have $9 \times 4 = 36$. This is not sufficient since $36 + 9 = 45 < 47$.

If $b = 5$, we have $9 \times 5 = 45$. This is sufficient because $45 + 2 = 47$. In this case, we can express 47 as $92_5$.
